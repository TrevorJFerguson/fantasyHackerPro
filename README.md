fantasy football chrome extension

this is a chrome extension that automatically compares league fantasy draft results from espn to the average ADP for the same players by consensus of mid and high-stakes pros

expected output: stylized divs within the espn/draft/recap page to quickly show good and bad picks versus consensus rankings

this is a slight readme change to test commit author
